                                      	<p>Luke 24: 13-35 Good morning to my friends at Cross Church. Turn in your Bibles to Luke 24. As you are finding the last chapter of Luke 24, I want to invite you to a powerful time of prayer two Sundays from today. I am calling our church to pray for spiritual awakening. Personal awakening… for our church to awaken, and for our nation to awaken.</p>

        </header>
        <p class="qw">Luke 24: 13-35 Good morning to my friends at Cross Church. Turn in your Bibles to Luke 24. As you are finding the last chapter of Luke 24, I want to invite you to a powerful time of prayer two Sundays from today. I am calling our church to pray for spiritual awakening. Personal awakening… for our church to awaken, and for our nation to awaken. There will be no sermon on Sunday, April 17, but simply a time for us to call out to God. ”Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed” (Romans 13:11). We need a spiritual awakening like no other time in my lifetime. Let’s gather together during all of morning worship services and beg God to bring fresh anointing on His people. What did Jesus do after His resurrection? Sometimes the truest things of the universe slip past us for our minds for less important matters. A girl walks into a school lunchroom for the first time and all eyes are on her. She wonders who will be her friend in a new school. She quickly leaves the room to retreat into the restroom where she cries in loneliness. Our minds are on the needs of the day but no one is caring for this teenage girl. Sometimes our minds miss the most important matters for the mundane. Years ago two people walked along a road with their hearts sunk to their stomach. These two were dejected in the worst of ways. These men nearly missed one of history’s great events. It’s here on the Road to Emmaus that you and I learn powerful lessons on how to experience a personal awakening. My aim this morning is this: for you to experience a personal time of worship. Today’s Scripture That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 14 and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 15 While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 17 And he said to them, ”What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, ”Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 19 And he said to them, ”What things?” And they said to him, ”Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 21 But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 23 and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” 25 And he said to them, ”O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 28 So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, 29 but they urged him strongly, saying, ”Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. 30 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. 31 And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. 32 They said to each other, ”Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” 33 And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, 34 saying, ”The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” 35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread. (Luke 24:13-35) Sermon Preview For many, this is one of their favorite stories in all the Bible. Watch these two as they Walk, as they Talk, and lastly as they Eat. Along the way, we’ll see Jesus move from stranger, to guest, and lastly to a friend. Let’s take the seven miles journey with these two and may your heart be warmed by Him along the way. 1. A Poignant Walk Beside a Stranger 1.1 Jesus was a Stranger We are not told the second person other than Cleopas was on the road. Was it Cleopas’ wife? Was it a friend? And while we don’t know Cleopas’ companion on this day, we certainly know more than Cleopas does from the beginning of the story. All through the narrative, we wait with eager anticipation for the two to finally identify who the stranger is. It’s this ”waiting for the other shoe to drop” that builds the tension in the story. 1.2 What a Walk! Yet, what a walk this must have been! You get something of the power of this conversation when you see their reaction when Jesus about to depart: ”but they urged him strongly, saying, ‘Stay with us…”’ (Luke 24:29). Surely, these two would have walked another seven miles with their mystery guest. The conversation was so good they never wanted it to end. It must have felt like the journey had just begun when it ended. A king would give His crown away to have such a walk with the Savior as these two had. Surely, these two looked at one another for the rest of their lives and said, ”We walked with Jesus and didn’t even know it.” ”The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field” (Matthew 13:44). You realize don’t you that the risen Christ is now available to walk with tens of thousands of people. Prior to His resurrection, He would have been available to one place at a time. Here He walks from Jerusalem to Emmaus, but by virtue of His resurrection, He walks the streets of village, cities, and neighborhoods everywhere. I pause to say, that Jesus loves to walk with you, His children. 1.3 Missing Jesus A young man knows he is a believer, yet he lacks a real joy, a real passion for Christ. A young lady loves the Lord, but her mother dies in a matter of months. She hurts because she doesn’t understand God’s ways. They have Jesus but they miss Jesus. There is no sorrow like losing Jesus. A believer is always down when Jesus is not present with them. You can never be happy if the Lord is hidden from you. Here were two individuals who missed Jesus. I find it insightful that even when their Lord was gone from them, they spoke of Him. Their passion for Christ was evident even when He was ”gone” from them. A lot of Christians today have all of the facts, but they lack the fire. They have theology, but they lack doxology. Dead orthodoxy is when you have the cardinal doctrines but there’s no expectation of meeting God. The church is turned in a religious cushion. ”And they said to him, ”Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God…” (Luke 24:19b). Circle the word ”was” in your Bible. They speak of Jesus in the past tense. They had seen Jesus walk on water and He called dead men from the tombs, yet they spoke of Him in the past tense. Jesus said to them: ”O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken” (Luke 24:25)! 1.4 Tenacious Faith But watch this … even though they were afraid that Jesus hadn’t risen from the dead, they were still followers of Him. When a stranger asked them what they were talking about so intensely, they identified themselves with Jesus immediately. Even though their faith was faulty, it was nevertheless, tenacious. When it was dangerous to be indentified with Jesus (remember Peter’s denial of Jesus on Friday?), they nevertheless, were unashamedly said they were followers of Christ. Think of it – they were afraid He had not risen from the dead yet they remained His disciples. Yes, they were confused. Yes, they were downcast and depressed. But would never give up on Jesus. To be like Job, ”Though he slay, yet will I trust Him” (Job 13:15 KJV). You need tenacious faith for tough times. If Jesus will search for us when we are sinners, will He not search us out when we’re saved but distant from Him? 1.5 Blindness ”But their eyes were kept from recognizing him” (Luke 24:16). Now, we have all had the experience of failing to recognize someone we know quite well. Here, Jesus is near but He is unrecognized. Jesus is incognito, if you will. Did you realize the Lord may be present with you even if you are not conscious of it? By some mysterious way, these two simply thought they were walking with an anonymous visitor to Jerusalem. Would they have spotted Jesus if they were EXPECTING to see Him? What if they had taken Jesus’ predictions about His resurrection seriously? What if they walked to Emmaus with the expectation that Jesus is alive and roaming the earth. What if they said to one another earlier that morning, ”Could He meet us even in our journey today?” So many times in our lives we are blinded to the presence of the Lord by unbelief. And then there was their ignorance. Part of the reason they didn’t see Jesus was due to their ignorance of Scripture. They were blind because they failed to Jesus plainly from Scripture. 2. An Engaging Talk with a Guest Their holy conversation was about to end after their walk with their mysterious guest. Did they pull on His arm to beg Him to stay? ”So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, 29 but they urged him strongly, saying, ”Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent” (Luke 2428-29). 2.1 What if They Hadn’t Insisted? Can you imagine these two had they not pressed Jesus to stay? Imagine the blessing they missed had they not insisted Jesus stay and eat with them. I can see the two sitting across the table asking one another, ”Why didn’t we insist on him staying?” These two would have experienced a sleepless night, tossing and turning in their beds as they missed the comfort the stranger brought them. The stranger was worth constraining to stay put for the night. Remember, we know what they didn’t – we know Who the Stranger is. We cannot let Him go. We must detain Him. He is worth pressing Him to stay. 2.2 What to Do When God is Confusing Some of you are not the joyful believer you used to be. Pray then like this: ”Lord, stay with me.” Some of you are hurting in a terrible time of affliction. ”Stay with me Lord and give me the light of Your presence. For Your Presence warms my heart like nothing else.” Unbelief offers the Lord no place to stay. Self-righteous pride pushes Him off the property. The world sees no beauty in Him while house after house locks their doors against His presence. Will you say to Him, ”Here is a place for you to stay. Come into my home. Stay in my life.” Let me show you a pattern in Scripture of people begging God to stay with them. Abraham at Mamre ”O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. 4 Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, 5 while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on-since you have come to your servant” (Genesis 18:3-5). Manoah and the Angel Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, ”Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you.” 16 And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, ”If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the Lord.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord.) (Judges 13:15-16) Jacob and God Then he said, ”Let me go, for the day has broken.” But Jacob said, ”I will not let you go unless you bless me” (Genesis 32:26). If you don’t have more of Him, it’s because you don’t want more of Him. ”Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied” (Matthew 5:6). Do you remember the story in the gospels where the blind men had to cry even louder in order for Jesus to stop? Often, God will not visit until your desire is intense. We are told to knock repeatedly in prayer. Do you keep on seeking Him or do you ask simply once? 2.3 Jesus in Crowded Places There are so many pressures in life that threaten to crowd out Jesus. There are financial concerns that crowd out Jesus. There are family concerns that crowd out Jesus. Be careful your heart isn’t a rock of ice so cold to the warm affection of Christ’s love. Let our hearts not forget to spend time with Christ. The happiest moments you’ll have are the time you spend in His company. We are never more alive than when He opens the Scripture for us. Let nothing so press you that you fail to say, ”Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” Now, pause and remember it was a stranger they asked into their home for they had yet to understand it was Jesus. ”Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares” (Hebrews 13:2). It was inhumane for them to allow this stranger to travel on without a place to rest: ”For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me…” (Matthew 25:35). Don’t let a crowded life crowd out your time of personal worship. 2.4 A Rebuke And he said to them, ”O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken” (Luke 24:25)! The person who loves the Lord doesn’t mind a rebuke from Him. ”Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit” (John 15:2). There’s no resentment from these two because Jesus disciplined them. 2.5 Jesus Taught And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself” (Luke 24:27) You know there’s never been a better school, there’s never been a better Teacher, and there’s never been a better explanation than these two had on that day. Here’s these two listened intently to Jesus as started in Genesis and went right through the Old Testament. ”You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me…” (John 5:39). They had a teachable heart. As they walked with this stranger, they sat at the Lord’s feet and became the Master’s disciples afresh. 3. A Cherished Meal with a Friend 3.1 The Reveal ”When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. 31 And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight” (Luke 24:30-31). Can you imagine the look on their face when they understood it was Jesus? Can you count the Goosebumps on their skin when they put it together? Can you clock their speed as they run off to tell the other disciples what happened? 3.2 They Had to Tell Others And when they saw Him, they had to tell others. Think of it: these two took off in the dead of night and traveled seven miles to tell others. Though they had just walked seven miles, they no sooner than sat down then they walked/ran the seven again. Oh, their enthusiasm! Whenever and wherever the Lord meets you, you tell others – even when it is inconvenient to do so. 3.3 The Passion They said to each other, ”Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures” (Luke 24:32)? It was July 12, 1739 when he was born. A contemporary, Benjamin Franklin, was but thirty-three years old. This young man was born one of nine children to his parents, Hezekiah and Dorothy. He would suffer from depression for much of his life and die of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-nine. Yet, this young man and graduate of Yale had a strong appetite for God. At his conversion on July 12, he later wrote these words to describe his powerful experience: ”As I was walking in a dark thick grave, ‘unspeakable glory’ seemed to open to the view and apprehension of my soul … It was a new inward apprehension or view that I had of God; such as I never had before, nor anything that I had the least remembrance of it. So that I stood still and wondered and admired … I had now no particular apprehension of any one person of the Trinity, either the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, but it appeared to be divine glory and splendor that I then beheld. And my soul ‘rejoiced wit joy unspeakable’ to see such a God, such a glorious divine being, and I was inwardly pleased and satisfied that he should be God over all forever and ever. My soul was so captivated and delighted with the excellency, the loveliness and the greatness and other perfections of God that I was even swallowed up in him, at least to that degree that I had no thought, as I remember at first, about my own salvation or scarce that there was such a creature as I.” That man was David Brainerd, whose diary was published in 1749 and has never been out of print in the nearly 300 years span of time. ”Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you” (James 4:8a). This is the way it is for believers. Our heart’s needle always turns toward true north. Whenever the Lord is near us, we burn with passion for Him. When a coal is placed near the fire, the embers are stirred hot. When you were first converted you would have stood in the rain to hear of Jesus’ love for you. You would have flown to another continent to get a glimpse of Christ. But for many, any excuse will do. Where is your warmth for Him? Why is your heart so cold toward Him?</p>

        </header>
        <p class="qwOne">Daniel 6:1-28 Today, we begin a new short series, entitled, Fearless: Possessing a Lionhearted Righteousness. This is a series designed give you a cup of courage. This is a series for people whose courage tank has sprung a leak. I have been asking some of you when and where you need courage. Zane needs courage to live for he lost his mother recently to ovarian cancer. Johnnie needs courage for he is caring for his wife who is dying with Dementia. And Kevin needs courage to do right in a work environment that threatens his job for simply doing right. I think about a high school senior visiting their future university for the first time. Over the course of the next three weeks, I want to look at three profiles of fearless people: Daniel, Esther, and David. We will look at three people from different backgrounds: an elderly man approaching 90 as well as two teenagers. We’ll see bold courage in both women and men. Where does real courage come from? How do you get courage when you need it? Today’s Scripture It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; 2 and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. 3 Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4 Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him. 5 Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.” 6 Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, “O King Darius, live forever! 7 All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. 8 Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.” 9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.” 10 When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.” (Daniel 6:1-10) 16 Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!” 17 And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. 18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him. 19 Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions. 20 As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?” 21 Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever! 22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.” 23 Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. (Daniel 6:16-23) This is one of the most enduring and well-known stories in all the Bible and all of literature. Daniel teaches us how to live when you believe in the one true God in a world where the morality compass is broken. For the next few moments, I want you to see how God gives your courage to live out your convictions. Like Daniel, we have been placed in a world of worry and fear. A world very different from the one we grew up in and a world that is evolving quickly. Gideon’s at Smithfield Middle School Recently, a senior adult man in our church related a story to me that I want you to hear. In the recent year, he has begun volunteering with Gideon’s, an organization dedicated to handing out Bibles in hotels, school, and in prisons. This retired man stood at Smithfield Middle School just off Davis in our city. He was standing on the sidewalk asking students if they would like a free Bible. When a police officer approached him. Not asking one question, the police officer began to complain about his presence and how they had received complaints about the Gideon’s. Parenthetically, my friend tells me there’s always two reactions to the Gideon’s handing out Bibles at local schools: many people thank them and many people complain they are there. So the police officer continues his complaint about the Gideon’s presence when he eventually recognizes they have a constitutional right to be there. Nevertheless, he eventually asks two questions after his mini-tirade. First, “Do you intend to remain here and hand out these Bibles?” My friend said he did intend to stay there. Second, the officer asked, “How many more of you are there?” When learning there was around three or four more men there surrounding the school, he takes off to share with them what he just said. That’s when the principal of the school intersected his path. The principal loves having the Gideon’s there and has said, “My kids need 3 or 4 Bibles each if you can give it to them.” After a few minutes of discussion between the principal and the officer, the officer throws up his hands and heads back to his car. It just so happened that the path to his police car was near my friend, the retired man who just got an earful from the officer. As the officer approached, this man simply asked him to pause and watch. It was then the Gideon asked two female students, “Would you like a free Bible?” and demonstrated the Gideon’s meant no harm. With this, the officer threw up his hands and walked off. We live a challenging world. And this series is dedicated to helping you find your courage to live for Christ in a broken world. I want you to see Daniel as a living, breathing example of what Proverbs 28:1 says: “The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion” (Proverbs 28:1). This is a series dedicated to helping you think right about what’s wrong in our world. I want to take you to the soil where bold courage grows. Sermon Preview Fear and Its Friends The Fundamentals of Courage The Focus of Faith 1. Fear and Its Friends The world is a scary place. Whether it is random shootings or the threat of jihad, many of us are scared like never before. There isn’t a follower of Christ who doesn’t at time struggle to reconcile what he knows about God and the challenges he faces. Often when our faith and our culture collide, fear seizes us. While fear is designed by God and it has a wonderful protective benefit for us, it can often lead us astray. Fear can cause us to shrink our where our courage should swell. Our story begins with the breakdown of administration of the government of the Persian Empire. This was the largest empire in world history at the time. Daniel was chosen and promoted at the expense of others. In today’s story, we see a number of “high officials,” or governmental officials who feared losing control to an outsider, Daniel. Let’s look at what motivated these high officials and satraps for a moment. 1.1 Jealousy & Anger – The Two Friends of Fear As the enemy will concentrate their fire on the best soldier so did these high officials choose Daniel to concentrate their jealousy. As ants swarm honey after a picnic so Daniel attracted these men’s jealousy. 1.2 Fear Leading to Frustration Fear travels in packs just a like a wolf. Only these men’s fears might best be described as paranoia. These “high officials” were losing control, and fear motivated them to conspire against him. Here’s something I’ve noticed about me: A cheap substitute for courage is anger and anger is often fueled by fear. I’m angry and frustrated when I cannot control the events in my life. I’m ticked off and I “go off” on a rant. Anger fuels my paranoia. Irony: They thought they were controlling the situation but in essence they were being controlled. Remember this: Evil can never manufacture enough glue to keep itself together. Evil plans have no lasting cohesion and evil plans will always dissolve. 2. The Fundamentals of Courage Where does real courage come from? How do you get courage when you need it? Some are born with personalities and dispositions that exude self-assurance. Yet, for most of us confidence has to be developed over time. But courage is more than feeling good about ourselves. Look with me at Daniel’s defiant prayer. 2.1 Daniel’s Spirit “Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom” (Daniel 6:3). Daniel is approximately 88 years old when he stood before King Darius. Remember than Daniel is a spoil of war. He is a trophy of war in that he was carried off to a strange land and made a salve. 2.1.1 Daniel’s Integrity “they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him” (Daniel 6:4b). In world where kickbacks were the norm, Daniel was pure and honest. “Then these men said, ‘We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God’” (Daniel 6:5). 2.2 Daniel’s Discipline I need to call attention to Daniel’s constant and consistent habit of prayer. It would have been an awesome experience to listen outside the doorway of Daniel’s prayer closet. Of all the spiritual disciplines a Christian does, surely prayer is the “lub-dub” beating of the heart. Prayer is a sign of trust – a sign of trust in God who does have the events of my life in His control. 2.3 Daniel’s Defiance Soon, Darius issues a decree for there to be no prayer for thirty days. Look at Daniel’s Reaction: “When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously” (Daniel 6:10). Daniel prays at the same place, at the hour, in the same position, and in the same spirit as he had done before. There was no alteration in his convictions. Daniel knew that if he were to stop praying as was his habit, it would look like he was complying with the new decree. You need to develop and live life with biblical convictions. You have three choices for your standards of right and wrong. 1. Internal Choice -Many of us look inside of us to find moral clarity. I can go with the choice that says, “I am going to believe based on what “I choose to be truth.” 2. External Choice- The second choice is what I call external choice. I will believe based on what everybody else is doing. 3. Eternal Choice -The third choice, the choice that I would encourage each us to carefully consider, is what I call the eternal choice: God is Truth. God is absolute. God is universal. God is unchanging. Note what Daniel didn’t do. Many Christians would rationalize and say, “So what if I pray in secret for the next 30 days.” Daniel didn’t look for a secret place to pray and he didn’t skip his morning, noon, and night devotions. Daniel didn’t pray with his windows shut and he didn’t adjust his prayers according to someone’s convenience. Daniel was a lion of a man for Daniel was a man of conviction. Friend, do right and leave the consequences up to God. The seductive allure of compromise is like a siren’s call. Do right and leave the consequences to God. I’m not talking about being obnoxious. I’m not talking about being unkind. There is a dastardly wind blowing over many of Christ’s people, where we don’t have the courage of our convictions! We have too many people reflecting the norms of our wicked society and calling themselves Christian. We need Christ-honoring, Bible-saturated people who lead the charge. We have sanitized a culture where no one has convictions. We are strangled by consensus when we don’t have the courage to stand alone in our convictions. He didn’t look for compromise but he went straight-forward in his path of prayer. He would not maintain his position at the expense of his convictions. 3. The Focus of Faith Certainly, we feel the sleepless night of the king as we rush with him to see if Daniel has been torn apart by lions. 3.1 We All Struggle with Fear Yes, all of us become fearful, discouraged, and frustrated. But to quote the Duke, “Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway.” You see, there was something different about Daniel – he had faith. And we ask here at this last point: where did Daniel get his backbone? What was his secret? Daniel’s courage wasn’t natural; instead, it was supernatural. 3.2. What is Faith? Courage is always produced by faith. And faith is God-confidence. “He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God…” (Daniel 6:10c). He had faith in God because he personally knew God was alive. Daniel had confidence from above: “and gave thanks before his God…” (Daniel 6:10c). Remember, “And without faith it is impossible to please him…” (Hebrews 11:6a). Daniel’s faith was from above. He had faith in God for good reason. God never has lost; He remains undefeated. He’s never crashed and He’s never been overloaded. We need to have our faith focused like a laser. Here are three components you’re going to need to increase your faith. 3.2.1 Your Personal Experience with God Far too many of you have borrowed faith – God is your father’s God, your pastor’s God, or your wife’s God. What you need is God to be YOUR God. You need to recognize there is a relationship between the strength of your faith & personal experience with God. 3.2.2 The Size of Your God You need to recognize there is a relationship between the strength of your faith and the size of your God. If you have little faith then your view of God is too small. Faith places the glory, the power, and the presence of God on display for all to see. Faith says, “God will come through.” One of the biggest obstacles to possessing lionhearted righteous boldness is simple: People are too big and God is too small. Fear grows when people are big and God is small. “For, ‘Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him’” (Hebrews 10:37-38). But conversely faith grows when God is big and people are small. 3.2.3 The Eye of Your Faith You need to shift your eyes from what threatens to destroy you to the One who promises to deliver you. The power of faith isn’t your faith itself. The power of faith is in the One you believe. Focus your faith by putting the crosshairs on Christ. Christ is the power that faith draws its strength from. Faith is sight even when the lights are off. I find it interesting that the story is from King Darius’ point of view. Even though Daniel wrote the account, the reader is taken inside the king’s bedroom rather than inside the lion’s den. And there’s a real irony here when we compare to two men’s perspectives that night: one man was at peace while the other was in conflict. We are told that the King “cried out in a tone of anguish” from the safety of his kingly palace (Daniel 6:20b). All the while it was discovered that “no kind of harm was found on” Daniel inside the lion’s den. When are working against God, you will not sleep even when you are in a sleep number mattress. But when you are in the will of God, you will sleep on a bed of lions. The king had every thing at his disposal for comfort and rest where Daniel only had the presence of God.</p>

            <p class="qwTwo">Isaiah 52:13-15 Do you have a friend who is upset about what God has not done? More and more people seem to be upset that God has not stopped some type of tragic event. One young lady is upset because God did not stop her father from dying at a relatively young age. Another father cannot believe in God because God hasn’t stopped his child’s cancer from advancing. ”I cannot believe in a god who allows so much pain and suffering in the world.” Maybe you know someone who wonders why God doesn’t seem to care. For the next 7 Sundays, I want to show you what God has done. Let me show you what God did – Christ died for you. Nowhere in all the Old Testament does the gospel shine more brilliantly than in Isaiah 53. This one chapter is quoted seven times in the New Testament and it is alluded to another 44 times in the New Testament. This is such a remarkable and unique passage that we are going to spend the next seven weeks allowing Isaiah 53 to prepare our hearts to celebrate Easter. One of the most surprising items for the earliest Christians was Jesus death on the cross. Yet, shortly after His resurrection, the early Christians were surprised again to discover the Old Testament had predicted Jesus but also His mysterious death for sinners. Can you imagine the impact of knowing much of Jesus’ life was predicted hundreds of years before He existed? Yes, there’s a lot of pain in this world and focusing on this may convince you God doesn’t care but I want to show you for the next few moments that God does care. This is a poem and it is a quotation from the very voice of God Himself. Chapter 53 really should begin at verse 13 of Isaiah 52 and it’s there we begin reading. ”Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted. 14 As many were astonished at you- his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind- 15 so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths because of him, for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand. 1 Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 2 For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. 3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned-every one-to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. 8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? 9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.” (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) There is a mysterious figure described in this chapter who is to come in the future. Remember, Isaiah’s ministry was around 2,700 years ago or approximately 700 years before Jesus. This is the Mount Everest of Old Testament predictions. Again, this is a mysterious figure who is to come and bring salvation. Isaiah calls this mysterious person a ”Servant” and this ”Servant” achieves something that makes infinite and eternal difference in the lives of people. The New Testament will come many years later and tell us that this mysterious figure is Jesus. There are five stanzas of three verses each to this poem. Notice that each stanza is little longer than the previous stanza. Let’s focus on the first predictions made in this first stanza in Isaiah 53:13-15 for the next few moments. Along the path of today’s message, pick up on this theme: Promise made … promise kept. 1. He Succeeds Where Others Fail 1.1 Who Are We Talking About? Notice Isaiah calls this mysterious person, ”my servant”: ”Behold, my servant…” (Isaiah 53:13a) This is climax of what is known as the ”Servant Songs” in Isaiah: 1) Isaiah 42:1-6; 2) Isaiah 49:1-3; Isaiah 50:4-9. Who is this Servant? There’s considerable debate over who this chapter is talking about. But it’s not just some ”Bible question” but it is a personal question. Mitch Glaser had grown up in a Jewish home where he attended Hebrew school in Queens, New York between the ages of eight and thirteen. Like any good Jewish boy, he had his Bar Mitzvah at age thirteen but later he dropped out of college in 1970 and move to California. He explored Eastern religions for a period of time but he received Jesus as his Messiah in November of 1970. He had read Isaiah 53 for the first time then and could not believe this chapter had been in his Hebrew Bible the whole time. He hitchhiked back across the country to his parent’s home in New Jersey to share the gospel with his parents. When he revealed his conversion, his mother and father stared at first, followed by his father gasping out loud and his mother crying. At that point, my parents told me that I had to leave the house and they began laying down the law. Mitch’s mother then told him that he could not go to church, read the New Testament, etc. That evening – supposedly to be his last night at home- Mitch asked his mother if I could show her why he believed Jesus was the Messiah. She said, ”Yes” but that I was not allowed to use the New Testament. So he begins to read Isaiah 53 to his mother. Mitch begins to read and by verse seven Mitch’s mother had fallen asleep. He woke her up and asked if he could keep reading. She sort of nodded in a sleepy stupor and at that point I finished the passage and said, ”So what do you think?” She said, ”I told you not to read the New Testament to me.” Jesus quotes Isaiah 53:12 between the Last Supper and Gethsemane: ”For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about me has its fulfillment” (Luke 22:37). This is only hours before Jesus is crucified. Peter also quotes Isaiah 53:5, ”by his wounds you have been healed” in 1 Peter 2:24 and applies it to Jesus. 1.2 The Success of Jesus ”Behold, my servant shall act wisely…” (Isaiah 53:13a). The words ”shall act wisely” don’t simply mean Jesus will be book-smart or even wise like your mother or father. Yes, Jesus is wise but in addition the prophet predicts that the Messiah will be effective and successful. Maybe your translation of Isaiah 53:13 says something like this: ”Behold, My servant will prosper…” (NASB) God is telling us He will sent a ”Servant” who will accomplish what Israel was not able to accomplish. The prophet predicts Jesus will accomplish God’s will – Jesus will be effective and successful. When I think of the wisdom of Jesus, I think of Jesus’ ability to navigate through an argument. Over and over again, the gospels show us how strong Jesus’ wisdom was through His teaching. ”And they came and said to him, ”Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?” But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, ”Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.” And they brought one. And he said to them, ”Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said to him, ”Caesar’s.” Jesus said to them, ”Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they marveled at him” (Mark 12:14-17). Again, when I think of Jesus’ success and wisdom, I think of His wise words. Remember, the enemies of Jesus’ attempted to entangle Jesus with their riddles and clever traps. Yet, Jesus is too wise to be entangled in such matters. Like waving His hand through cobwebs, Jesus’ wisdom baffled His adversaries. Promise made … promise kept 1.2.1 The Success of Jesus vs. Adam ”And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry” (Luke 4:1-2). Look at three connections Jesus and Adam for a moment. 1) Adam was directly the son of God but Jesus has an even greater relationship to God – He was born of a virgin (Luke 1:35). 2) Where Adam failed, Jesus succeeded. Adam was tempted and failed, bringing all of his people into misery. Jesus, the Second Adam, is tempted, but He does not fail. 3) The first Adam failed in the Garden and was defeated by temptation but the Second Adam, Jesus, succeeded in the Desert. And the first Adam has a companion to help him, but Jesus had no one with Him. 1.2.3 The Success of Jesus vs. Israel Jesus spends forty days in the desert where Israel spent forty years in the wilderness. The people of Israel were fed manna, a food that God supernaturally dropped out of the skies to feed His people. Jesus, in direct contrast, was also in the wilderness. Despite God providing their food, the people of Israel sinned – they grumbled against God Where Israel ate and failed, Jesus succeeded and was hungry. I heard it said this week that the relationship between the New Testament and the Old Testament is like a bow tie. Can you picture a bow tie for a moment? God starts with Israel but the people of Israel are more and more unfaithful as time goes by the triangle on the left. Ultimately, all of Israel comes down to just one true Israelite – Jesus. Jesus is the knot in the middle of the bow tie. Isaiah keeps eliminating Israelites until he finds one faithful Israelite who is obedient to God. You can hear Jesus say, ”I am the true vine” because the former vine, Israel, has disqualified itself. From Jesus, a whole new people of God emerge – the triangle on the right. God remakes us into obedient people in Jesus. Promise made … promise kept. 2. He Starts Small but Finishes Big ”As many were astonished at you- his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind” (Isaiah 52:14). The traditional hero is viewed as a powerful, mighty conqueror. There’s an expectation that the hero will kill the enemy and conquer evil. God, however, often does things in ways that defy our standards. Isaiah loves to put contrasts in front of us when he’s speaking of the future Servant. Like showing black and white or tall versus short, he wants us to know that the future Messiah will be humiliated before he’s exalted. Even though the Servant will eventually be exalted, he will not start out this way. Instead, people will be ”appalled” to look at Jesus (Isaiah 53:14). The word ”appalled” is a very strong word – it means to be shattered. It’s actually a word that can be used to mean a city that has just been invaded and destroyed, turned to rubble. When it’s used of a person, for a person to be appalled means to be so shattered by something they’re looking at so as to want to vomit. There’s this horrible mixture in Jesus’ life as predicted here. Look at how low Jesus begin His life: ”we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.” (Isaiah 53:4b) Yet, eventually ”…he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted.” (Isaiah 53:13b). This astounding mixture of light and darkness, of success and defeat, of sunshine and storm is always there in the lives of the great servants. Don’t you dare say, ”Well, if God really loved me and was really working in my life, he wouldn’t let these terrible things happen to me.” Understand this: God’s wise love in your life is completely compatible with the very rough, difficult experience of Jesus. Jesus’ life began in Bethlehem as small, insignificant and unimportant but grew to eternal and cosmic proportions.. 3. He Suffers Where You Don’t Expect it There are two timeless questions: what is wrong with the human race (what’s wrong with me)? Second, what can be done about it? Let me show how Jesus effects both of these questions. 3.1 Philip, the Ethiopian Eunuch and Acts 8 In Acts 8 we find a man known to us as the ”Ethiopian Eunuch” and he is reading the scroll from Isaiah. ”Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: ”Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth” (Acts 8:32-33). The Ethiopian Eunuch is reading from Isaiah 53:7-8. These two verses describe the innocent and submissive death of the Servant. Philip asks, ”Do you understand what you are reading?” (Acts 8:30b) The Ethiopian Eunuch says in effect, ”who is this passage talking about?” (see Acts 8:34). So, Philip connects the dots between Isaiah’s prediction of the Servant’s humiliating death that shocks everyone who sees it: ”And the eunuch said to Philip, ”About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus” (Acts 8:34-35). Far from being applauded by men, Isaiah says He will be ”despised and rejected” (Isaiah 53:3). He would be a ”man of sorrows” and ”acquainted with grief.” 3.2 The Sprinkling the Nations ”so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths because of him, for that which has not been told them they see, and that which they have not heard they understand” (Isaiah 53:15). his mysterious figure will act like an Old Testament priest and will sprinkle people clean. What is so astonishing about Jesus? Why will kings shut their mouths? Because God cares for you and takes a crushing burden off you. The kings of the earth witness the God’s care for lowliest on the earth and they are silenced. Isaiah 53 ”looks as if it had been written beneath the cross upon Golgotha.” This is the best single chapter in the whole Bible to explain what happened on the cross. ”Jesus was born with the shadow of the cross upon him. With the shadow of the cross upon his heart, he learned to walk, he learned to talk, he learned to work. From his earliest moment upon this earth it was his burden by day, his pallet by night.” R. G. Lee A moment I told you the story of Mitch Glaser reading this poem to his mother. Remember her reply? – ”I told you not to read the New Testament to me.” Why would she say this? Here is the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53: – Who borne our griefs (verse 4) – Who carried our sorrows (verse 4) – Who was wounded for our transgressions (verse 5) – Who was bruised for our iniquities (verse 5) – Who was chastised for our peace (verse 5) – Who heals us by His stripes (verse 5) – Who borne our iniquities (verses 6, 11) – Who was oppressed, afflicted (verse 7) – Who was slaughtered (verse 7) – Who was cut off (verse 8) – Who was stricken for our transgressions (verse 8) – Who was bruised by the Lord (verse 10) – Who was put to grief (verse 10) – Whose soul was made a sin offering (verse 10) – Who poured out His soul unto death (verse 12) – Who was numbered with the transgressions (verse 12) – Who bore the sin of many (verse 12) – Who made intercession for the transgressors (verse 12) Let others focus on what God hasn’t done, you focus on what God has done for you. Promise made, promise kept. Conclusion As the great song Before the Throne of God Above reminds us: Because the sinless Savior died,?My sinful soul is counted free.?For God the just is satisfied,?To look on Him and pardon me.</p>
